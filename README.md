# Shopping Rewards API

A Spring Boot application to calculate and retrieve reward points for customers based on their purchase transactions.
---
## Reward Calculation Logic
- Customers receive **2 points** for every dollar spent **over $100** in each transaction.
- Customers receive **1 point** for every dollar spent **between $50 and $100** in each transaction.
- No points are awarded for spending below $50.

## Description
This project provides RESTful API endpoints built with Spring Boot to calculate and retrieve reward points earned by customers based on their transaction history. It supports generating both complete reward statements and statements limited to the last three months.
- The API endpoints are defined in the RewardController class, adhering to standard REST API design principles.
- The core business logic resides in the RewardServiceImpl class, which implements the RewardService interface to ensure loose coupling and maintainability.
- For fetching data logic TransactionRepository contains methods.
- Exception handling is centralized in the GlobalExceptionHandler class, which also manages custom exceptions like          TransactionNotFoundException,InvalidDataException and NotFoundException.
- Unit tests are implemented in the RewardsServiceImplTest and RewardControllerTest classes to ensure the correctness of business logic and API behavior.
